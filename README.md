# ðŸ¤– DACA - OpenAI Agents SDK

This project outlines the **core principles** of building with the OpenAI Agents SDK using a **cloud-first**, **agent-native** approach. DACA stands for a development framework where **AI is at the center** of application logic, with a focus on flexibility, portability, and reliability.

## ðŸš€ Core Principles of DACA

1. **AI-First Approach**  
   Everything is driven by **agentic AI** â€” decisions, logic, and interactions are handled through agents.

2. **Agent-Native, Cloud-First**  
   Our agents are designed to run seamlessly across **cloud-native environments**.

3. **Develop Anywhere**  
   You can build, test, and deploy your agents from **any development environment**.

4. **Cloud Anywhere**  
   Agents are designed to run on **any cloud provider** â€” AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.

5. **Open Core with Managed Edges**  
   All components are **open source**, with managed standards ensuring reliability. We avoid unknown or unstable packages that cause production issues or developer delays.

## ðŸ§  LLM Context and Tooling

The LLM (Large Language Model) supports the following 4 elements to function effectively:

1. **System Prompt / Persona**  
   Defines the role, behavior, and tone of the agent.

2. **User Prompt**  
   The actual input/query given by the user.

3. **Tool's Schema**  
   Defines how tools should be structured and understood by the agent.

4. **Tool's Message**  
   The response or action performed by the tool, sent back to the LLM.
